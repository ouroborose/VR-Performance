# Time to Completion
8 hours including viewing lessons, planning, optimizing, testing.

# 1 thing I liked
Optimization was never something I cared about in my past game projects, but this assignment taught me the importance of performance and optimization, especially for VR games.

# 1 thing that was challenging
The performance would fluctuate seemingly at random and it was hard to pin down, even with the profiler, deep profile, and autoconnected profiler build. I chalked it up to my older GPU and many processes open on my desktop. It performed much better when other processes were closed.
